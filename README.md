This code is a script designed to tidy up a Google Sheets document by removing duplicate entries based on a specific identifier called "SAP ID." It operates in a non-technical manner to make managing data more efficient and organized.

Here's how it works:

1. **Identifying Duplicates:** The script looks at a specific column in the Google Sheets document, where each row represents a different entry. It's on the lookout for entries with the same "SAP ID."

2. **Keeping the First Occurrence:** When the script identifies a duplicate SAP ID, it takes action to maintain data integrity. It preserves the first occurrence of the SAP ID (the original entry) and removes all subsequent duplicates. This ensures that you keep the earliest record while eliminating redundancy.

3. **Ease of Use:** You can customize which column in your spreadsheet contains the SAP IDs by specifying the column number in the code. Then, you can manually trigger this script when needed to clean up your data and ensure that only the initial entries for each SAP ID are retained.

In essence, this script helps streamline your data management process by automating the removal of duplicate entries, allowing you to maintain a more organized and efficient Google Sheets document.
